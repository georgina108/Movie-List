# Movie List App

Use any framework you want to create a movie list app! The levels get increasingly difficult and some refactoring may be necessary. Wireframes accompany each level to give you a better idea of what that level should include. 

## Level 0
- [ ] Display a list of movies from hardcoded data.

You can use the following data: 

```javascript
var movies = [
  {title: 'Mean Girls'},
  {title: 'Hackers'},
  {title: 'The Grey'},
  {title: 'Sunshine'},
  {title: 'Ex Machina'},
];
```

When you're done, you can check out [Level 1](https://gist.github.com/beth/a9626adab3042e740e3f4245a7b99093)!
